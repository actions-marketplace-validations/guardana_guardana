"""A scenario and an agent run declare their own samples, and a bad script is refused.

The single-turn shape has had `fixtures:` since 0.18; these two had nothing, so the
seven declarative built-ins of those shapes could not be sampled at all and a third
party copying them could not sample theirs.

What is worth testing here is not "a fixture passed". It is every way a script can
look complete and prove something other than what its author wrote: a turn the run
never reads, a scripted run that truncates into `inconclusive`, a double replayed
across two verifications.
