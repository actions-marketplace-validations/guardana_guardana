"""K independent attempts at one case, and what they add up to.

A deployed model samples, so one reply per prompt says only that the failure was not
observed this time. A rule that repeats makes K attempts at every case, records each
one, and reduces them here. Why, and what was rejected:
[`docs/design/repeated-trials.md`](../../../../../docs/design/repeated-trials.md).

Every statistic is computed over **cases**, never over pooled trials: the K trials of
one prompt are correlated, so "0 of 60 trials" is not sixty independent observations.
