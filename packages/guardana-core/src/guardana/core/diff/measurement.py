"""How the measurement channel moved between two runs, paired case by case.

What the change list cannot show: *over how many cases*. A suite that graded forty
yesterday and twelve today reports fewer findings, which every change kind reads
as an improvement.

Deliberately not a second report of per-case pass→fail — that already reaches the
comparison as a `Finding`, and counting it twice would double the one thing the
diff is most careful about. What is new is the denominator, the pairing, and the
refusal to compare cases whose definition moved.
