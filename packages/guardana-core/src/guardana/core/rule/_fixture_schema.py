"""Parse a YAML rule's `fixtures:` block into declared samples, one shape at a time.

Every declarative rule kind grades something different — a reply, a conversation,
an agent run — so each one's fixture scripts a different thing, and each is
validated against what that rule actually declares: the number of steps, the
tools it offers, the step budget it may spend. That is why these parsers take the
rule's own declaration rather than only the mapping: a `call:` naming a tool
nobody offers, or a script longer than `max_steps`, has to fail where a typo
fails, not halfway through a verification.

An artifact rule needs bytes, and bytes in YAML is either a path to a checked-in
malicious file or base64 nobody can review — so a plugin rule overrides
`Rule.fixtures()` in Python instead, using the builders `guardana.core.testing`
already ships.
